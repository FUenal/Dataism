# **Data Science for Social Sciences**
### *Social Scientific Research Methods Using R* {style="padding-top: 0px;"}

Last updated: `r Sys.Date()`


This page is designed to provide you with the necessary resources and a step-by-step guide to learn (or teach) the fundamentals of Data Science in R. It is mainly designed for a social scientist audience, meaning you are training as a psychologist, sociologist, political scientist, etc., and you want to augment your skills to run all your analyses in a powerful programming language while also expanding into more novel data science techniques such as Machine Learning, Web Scraping and more. The materials provided here are designed for people with **no previous programming experience** or familiarity with traditional social scientific methods. 

The entire course is build on the excellent textbook *Introduction to Data Science* by Prof Rafael A. Irizarry (Harvard University). The textbook has also been adapted for an online course on edX. Here, I provide an augmented version of these materials by blending them with several courses available on DataCamp which complement each other and allow you to practice and apply your skills on real-world datasets. Together, these resources form **a step-by-step syllabus which will allow you to teach yourself R in an interactive and fun way!** The materials used here are carefully selected and blended such that they complement and reinforce each other. The combination of online reading materials, video lectures, and practical courses and projects will allow for a **smooth and efficient learning experience.**

Most materials are **free and open**, including the primary textbook [*Introduction to Data Science*](https://rafalab.github.io/dsbook/). The accompanying video lectures on edX are also freely available. You can watch the lectures on edX without opting in for a paid certification. I will provide assessment materials to test your learning success as you work through the syllabus. For students taking my course here at the University of Cambridge I will provide free access to the DataCamp materials by the beginning of the semester. If you are not participating my University course, you will need to purchase a subscription for access to DataCamp.
