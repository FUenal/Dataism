# **Data Science for Social Sciences**
### *Statistical Methods in Social Scientific Research Using R* {style="padding-top: 0px;"}

#### Dr Fatih Uenal
Last updated: `r Sys.Date()`


This page is designed to give you the nessecary resources to learn or teach R. It is designed for a social scientist audience, meaning you are trained as a psychologist, sociologist, political scientist, etc., and you want to augment your skills to run all your analyses in a powerful programming language while also expanding into more novel data science techniques such as Natural Language Programming, Machine Learning, Web Scraping and more.

I have provided resources and a step-by-step syllabus so that you can teach yourself R using freely available resources that interactive and fun! The materials used here are carefully selected from a broad range of resources and blended together such that they complement each other. We draw on a variety of online reading materials and practical courses to allow for a smooth and efficient learning experience.

Most of the materials provided here are designed for people with no previous programming experience but general familiarity with traditional social scientific methods.  This includes basic research design and fundamental statistics (the general linear model, i.e., ANOVA and regression).  Although I have compiled these materials from the perspective of social psychology (i.e., empirical psychology), the content can be easily applied to any social scientific field. 


All materials are totally **free and open**, including [all reading materials](https://fuenal.github.io/dataism/Resources.html). However, for the DataCamp courses, you will need a subscription, if you are not enrolled in our University provided course.

### Copying/Adopting these materials

This website is written using R Markdown. The source code is adapted from Dr Matt Crump's awesome webpage here [Link](https://github.com/CrumpLab/psyc3400).  For anyone interested in adopting these materials, the idea is you can fork the repo for the [website](https://github.com/CrumpLab/psyc3400). Then edit as desired for your own purposes, as did I. I also draw on another great resource for Data Science teaching which works with a blend of reading materials combined with online practices [website](http://datascience.tntlab.org/).
