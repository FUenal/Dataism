### Course Description 

An application-oriented introduction to modern statistical modeling and inference: study design, descriptive statistics, data visualization, random variables, probability and sampling distributions, point and interval estimates, hypothesis tests, re-sampling procedures, and multiple regression. A wide variety of applications from the natural and social sciences will be used. Classes meet for lecture/discussion with activities and exercises that emphasize analysis of real data.

### Textbook


  - OpenIntro: Introductory Statistics with Randomization and Simulation (2014)
      Diez, Barr and Çetinkaya-Rundel, 1st edition
  - The textbook is free and open-source; the digital editions can be [downloaded for free](https://www.openintro.org/) and paperback copies can be purchased at the           bookstore or on Amazon for less than $10. The book is available in three formats:
      [PDF](https://www.openintro.org/download.php?file=isrs1)
      [tablet-friendly PDF](https://www.openintro.org/download.php?file=isrs1)
      paperback edition from [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Introductory-Statistics-Randomization-Simulation-David/dp/1500576697)


The textbook is not just a reference to use after the instructor has presented new material but a sourcebook to use at every stage of learning. When all students read the text before class, the nature of the class meeting changes to the benefit of everyone. You will have thought about the material, and you will arrive with your own questions. You’ll be ready to discuss what you understand, to clarify what you don’t understand, and to hear more on the topic. You need to read the book prior to class as well as review the material after we’ve discussed it in class.

Class time will focus on activities to help understand concepts. You should also bring the book to class (in either electronic or paper form), as I will be referencing it regularly.

### Materials

### tidy syntax

I provide students with a cheatsheet entitled [All the R you need for intro stat](https://github.com/FUenal/dataism/blob/master/all_the_R_you_need_tidy.Rmd), which gives them an overview of the most important code for the semester. Each week, I post RMarkdown documents on Canvas (also [hosted on GitHub](https://github.com/FUenal/dataism/blob/master/tidy/) for sharing), and accompanying videos on [the YouTube playlist for the class](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLik6fAQnSI93eBVuAONFBCVdOd7VFhKQX).

### Assessment and Evaluation:

#### DataCamp Lessons

Each **Thursday**, lessons will be assigned from datacamp.com. Some of these lessons will be complete DataCamp courses, and others will be specific modules of courses. This will all be managed by assigning content to your (free) DataCamp account. The amount
of content assigned will vary between one and two courses of content. DataCamp considers a course to be roughly 4 hours of lessons, which includes practice time. Realistically, the time you need will depend upon how intuitive you find R to be. For students already familiar with other programming languages and those with previous R experience, “8 hours” of courses is realistically closer to 2 hours; for complete novices that also find the material difficult, 8 hours is a realistic estimate. It is strongly recommended that you stretch out DataCamp lessons across the assignment period, for example, allocating 1 hour each day between Thursday and Tuesday. You will gain the most by treating this as a foreign language immersion course by using R every day, including for your own research.

```
</a>

#### Weekly Assignments

Each **Thursday**, the previous week’s assignment, which is designed to test how well you can apply that week’s DataCamp lessons in combination with any material introduced **Tuesday**, will be due by 6 AM. In general, these assignments are designed to take less than 4 hours if you are on top of the DataCamp lessons, and the files you create should be submitted via **Blackboard**.

#### Grading (total of 100)

On **Thursday** of **Week 14**, a comprehensive project will be assigned integrating many of the skills learned over the previous 14 weeks. This will be due the last day of classes **this semester, Month Day, at 11:59 PM**. This project will be designed to mimic a research project, involving obtaining and importing data, processing it in a variety of requested ways, and creating several visualizations and output tables of the type that might be included in an APA-style paper. It will also include learning a new R package and using it correctly in your dataset, which assesses your ability to generalize lessons learned from the course content.

#### Final Exam

The final exam for this course is a 3-hour live coding session. This exam will test your ability to do basic coding tasks in a reasonable amount of time (of much less complexity than the kind you’ll demonstrate in the comprehensive project). You will be required to bring a laptop to the final exam and submit your final exam on Blackboard by the end of the exam period.

#### Cell phones

Your cell phone, PDA or other device must be turned off during class. If you are a habitual offender in this respect (i.e. it happens more than twice during the semester), you will be asked to leave the classroom. If you absolutely need to have your phone on during class—talk to me at the beginning of the semester.


#### Keep the room clean


Please pick up after yourself. Absolutely no food is allowed in the lecture and lab rooms.

### Email Correspondence

I will regularly use e-mail to send out announcements, changes in the syllabus, reminders about tests or due dates, etc. It is your responsibility to check e-mail regularly to keep up-to-date with these announcements. I will use the e-mail address you have listed with the College. Therefore, please make sure that this is indeed the correct address.


#### General Help with Research and Writing
