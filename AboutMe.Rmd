Currently, I am working as a visiting postdoctoral researcher at the [Cambridge Social Decision-Making Lab](https://www.sdmlab.psychol.cam.ac.uk/) (University of Cambridge, UK). I am passionate about data-driven knowleddge production  with a specific focus on phenomena such as climate change, environmentalism, Islamophobia, racism, sexism, and speciesism. I am analyzing these topics from social and evolutionary psychological perspectives.
