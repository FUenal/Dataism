### Catalog Description

Basic descriptive and inferential statistics including the elements of experimental designs in social sciences research. Additional Data Science Techniques and advanced statistical analyses (optional)

### Course Objectives

“Data science” is a catch-all term used to describe the practice of working with and analyzing messy data sources to draw meaningful conclusions using techniques developed by computer scientists and computational statisticians. The purpose of this course is to give students who are training as quantitative social scientists a broad introduction to this skillset via the statistical programming language, R. You will learn how to conduct many statistical analyses such as univariate statistics (e.g., ANOVA, correlation, regression) in R that you have already done in SPSS, Excel, or another such program. Additionally, we will build on this foundation to explore new skillsets uncommon in the social sciences, such as natural language processing, automated data curation, and machine learning. I have also included more advanced statistical analysis (SEM) as optional choice.

At the end of this course you will be able to:

1. To answer research questions in Social Sciences (e.g., Psychology) with data

2. Understand the basics of research designs in Social Sciences, and how they relate to data-analysis strategies

3. Develop an intuitive, practical, and conceptual understanding of strategies for asking and answering questions with data

4. To use R, a free and open-source statistics software program.

5. Develop a basic understanding of frequently used Data Science Techniques.

6. Practice your newly acquired skills with interesting, interactive and fun porjects.

NOTE: The schedule and procedures described in this syllabus are subject to change depending on specific needs and requirements. You will always be notified of changes on the homepage (see "last update").

### Resources (freely available)

The reading materials for this course are selected from freely available and frequently used sources online as web-books. Each of these sources have their own strengths and merits. In curating this course, I have tried to create the best fit between reading material and online courses (Datacamp). I have also tried to present a balanced mix between Data Science and classical Social Science related Intstruction books. All materials linked in this course include further relevant material on a broad range of relevant topic and I encourage you to browse through them. Also, I encourage you to make use of the existing exercises within each of the here referenced resources:

### Assessment and Evaluation:

#### DataCamp Lessons

Each **Thursday**, lessons will be assigned from datacamp.com. Some of these lessons will be complete DataCamp courses, and others will be specific modules of courses. This will all be managed by assigning content to your (free) DataCamp account. The amount
of content assigned will vary between one and two courses of content. DataCamp considers a course to be roughly 4 hours of lessons, which includes practice time. Realistically, the time you need will depend upon how intuitive you find R to be. For students already familiar with other programming languages and those with previous R experience, “8 hours” of courses is realistically closer to 2 hours; for complete novices that also find the material difficult, 8 hours is a realistic estimate. It is strongly recommended that you stretch out DataCamp lessons across the assignment period, for example, allocating 1 hour each day between Thursday and Tuesday. You will gain the most by treating this like a foreign language immersion course by using R every day, including for your own research.

```

#### Weekly Assignments

Each **Thursday**, the previous week’s assignment, which is designed to test how well you can apply that week’s DataCamp lessons in combination with any material introduced **Tuesday**, will be due by 6AM. In general, these assignments are designed to take less than 4 hours if you are on top of the DataCamp lessons, and the files you create should be submitted via **Blackboard**.

#### Grading (total of 100)

On **Thursday** of **Week 14**, a comprehensive project will be assigned integrating many of the skills learned over the previous 14 weeks.This will be due the last day of classes **this semester, Month Day, at 11:59PM**. This project will be designed to mimic a research project, involving obtaining and importing data, processing it in a variety of requested ways, and creating several of visualizations and output tables of the type that might be included in an APA-style paper. It will also include learning a new R package and using it correctly in your dataset, which assesses your ability to generalize lessons learned from course content.

#### Final Exam

The final exam for this course is a 3-hour live coding session. This exam will test your ability to do basic coding tasks in a reasonable amount of time (of much less complexity than the kind you’ll demonstrate in the comprehensive project). You will be required to bring a laptop to the final exam and submit your final exam on Blackboard by the end of the exam period.

#### Cell phones

Your cell phone, PDA or other device must be turned off during class. If you are a habitual offender in this respect (i.e. it happens more than twice during the semester), you will be asked to leave the classroom. If you absolutely need to have your phone on during class—talk to me at the beginning of the semester.


#### Keep the room clean


Please pick up after yourself. Absolutely no food is allowed in the lecture and lab rooms.

### Email Correspondence

I will regularly use e-mail to send out announcements, changes in the syllabus, reminders about tests or due dates etc. It is your responsibility to check e-mail regularly to keep up-to-date with these announcements. I will use the e-mail address you have listed with the College. Therefore, please make sure that this is indeed the correct address.
