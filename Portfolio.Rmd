### Installing R and R-Studio
[R](http://www.r-project.org) is a free open-source programming language that can be used for statistical analysis, data-simulation, data visualization, and lots of other things, like building this website. Another free program is [R-studio](http://www.rstudio.com). It provides a nice graphic interface for R. Download R first, then download R-studio. Both are compatible with PCs, Macs, or Linux. For this course, you will need to download both programs and follow the course materials outlined in the [syllabus](https://fuenal.github.io/dataism/Syllabus.html). 

```{r echo=F,include=F,error=F}
library(vembedr)
```


```{r echo=F,error=F}
embed_youtube("aCP8X7Pnh4o", width = NULL,
  height = 500,
  ratio = c("16by9", "4by3"),
  frameborder = 0,
  allowfullscreen = TRUE) %>% 
  use_align(align = "center")
```



- Installing R: Go to the [R website](http://www.r-project.org) and download the installer file. Once downloaded, open the installer file and follow the instructions.

### Resources

The reading and video materials used on this website are based on Prof Rafael Irizarry`s work which are publicly available:

Irizarry, R. (2019). Introduction to Data Science. Data Analysis and Prediction Algorithms with R. eBook available at https://rafalab.github.io/dsbook/


### Additional R resources

1. Google knows, ask Google.
2. [Stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com) is awesome, pure, and simple. Chances are high that someone else has had a similar question as you and usually you find that many people have answered your question already.
3. Danielle Navarro wrote a [free Psych Stats textbook using R](https://compcogscisydney.org/learning-statistics-with-r/), it's worth checking out (some of our reading materials are based on her work)
4. Another solid and accessible resource for Data Science and social science statistics using R [http://datascience.tntlab.org/](http://datascience.tntlab.org/). The approach taken in this course is an augmented version of the tnt-approach.
5. One of my favorite websites is Erin Buchanan's fantastic [Statistics of Doom](https://statisticsofdoom.com/) repository. It contains a ton of great materials for R, SPSS, JASP covering all levels of statistical analysis with some hands-on youtube videos, r-codes, exercises, and other materials to guide you through the Stats.
